1. 	Abstract

   Web APIs [1] are becoming a crucial part of the Web. Unfortunately however, it remains
   very difficult to determine the location of these APIs on servers around the Web by
   automated means. The only way to discover APIs and their properties is via human
   driven search through public search engines or in hand curated API Directory listings
   such as ProgrammableWeb [2]. While these methods work, neither can scale to the potentially
   hundreds of thousands and millions of APIs which will be published over the next few years.

   The objective of the format described in this document is to provide a simple means
   for individuals and organizations to document the location of their
   API Services on a given domain in a machine readable way. The format is designed
   for public deployment and for consumption by automated software agents (robots).

   This document is written in loose RFC style for the purposes of clarity, but
   it is not an official recommendation. Discussion around the format takes place
   on the API Json Mailing list [3].

2. 	Introduction

   Web APIs have quickly become an important part of Web Infrastructure. However the
   amount of machine readable meta-data about the location and capabilities of these APIs
   remains extremely limited.

   A number of machine readable formats for describing Web API Interfaces have emerged.
   Unfortunately however adoption of these formats is not widespread and further, where
   they are used it is in turn not clear where to look for these definition files
   themselves. This document takes no position on which of these formats is best, but
   aims to solve the problem of where to find the descriptions in the first place.

   In other words, it means to provide a mechanism to bootstrap meta-data discovery for APIs.

   The objective of the format defined in this document is to provide a lightweight means
   for individuals and organizations to document the location of their APIs, the associated
   descriptions, human and machine readable specification and ancillary information (such
   as licensing, maintainers and so forth).

3. 	Specification

   This section defines the API Meta Data Format. The following terminology is used throughout:

   * File: instance of a digital file containing data.
   * Apis.* file, a file which contains API Meta Data information compatible with this
     document and uses one of the defined content types [currently JSON, YAML and TXT]. A file
     may contain more than one API Specification.
   * API Specification: collection of information about a specific API expressed in the
     format defined in this document. Uniqueness is determined by the primary root/base
     URL of the API.

3.1.	Access method

   The definitions of API Meta Data MUST be accessible by HTTP or HTTPS or Both from
   either the site on which the referenced APIs are operating or another site (see below
   for information on Authoritative and Non-Authoritative definitions) as a resource of
   Internet Media Type as determined by the content type under
   a standard relative path on the server: "/apis.*", where * is determined by the
   content type of the file.

   For convenience we will refer to this resource as the "/apis.*
   file", though the resource need in fact not originate from a file-
   system.

   Some examples of URLs for sites and URLs for corresponding
   "/apis.*" sites:

     http://www.foo.com/apis.txt

     http://www.bar.com:8001/apis.json

   If the server response indicates Success (HTTP 2xx Status Code)
   the robot must read the content, parse it, and follow any
   instructions applicable.

   If the server response indicates the resource does not exist (HTTP
   Status Code 404), the robot can assume no instructions are
   available.

   If the robot parses the file it may discover references to further apis.*
   files elsewhere on the same filesystem or elsewhere on the Internet. It may
   choose to download these files also and take into account the information
   contained within them.

   While the format is intended to be human readable and may be used by humans, it
   is primarily intended for consumption by automated software systems. Such software
   systems may be part of search engines, testing frameworks or API using applications.
   In keeping with terminology from the robots.txt format they are referred to as robots
   from here onwards.

3.2.  Authority

3.121	   Authoritative

  An entry in a apis.* file is AUTHORITATIVE for a given domain if the root domain of
  the API described by the entry is on the same DNS domain or on a DNS subdomain thereof.

3.2.2	   Non-Authoritative

   An entry in an apis.* file for an API is NON-AUTHORITATIVE if it is not AUTHORITATIVE.

3.2.3    Authority by Reference

   For Discussion: We may wish to allow the case where a top level apis.json file on a given domain has
   pointers to files on other servers which define APIs on the domain of the first
  file. These could then be considered authoritative. This is complex but might be a real
   use case.

3.2.4.   Conflict Resolution

   In cases where a robot discovers more than one entry in separate apis.* files for a
   a specific API, priority on the validity of information should generally be resolved
   as follows:

   * Authoritative entries have priority over non-authoritative.
   * Where two or more authoritative entries exist on different subdomains, the
     entry in the file closest to the specific domain of the root domain of the API
     shall have priority.

   Example for an API with DNS domain http://mainapi.commerce.company.com/ where entries
   are present at:

   * http://company.com/apis.json
   * http://commerce.company.com/apis.json

   The later would be interpreted as the most Authoritative.

3.3. 	Formal Syntax

3.3.1.	JSON or YAML Format

   This is a proposed specification for an apis.json or apis.yaml file, which can be placed in the
   root of any domain, providing a single inventory of all API resources available within
   that domain, as well as pointers to other associated api.json files.

   A file shall be in JSON or YAML format and contain the following elements:

    * aid [Mandatory]: A unique identifier for the collection, consisting of [root domain]:[string] (ie. apis.json:spec-example)
    * name [Mandatory]: text string of human readable name for the collection of APIs
    * description [Mandatory]: text human readable description of the collection of APIs.
		* type [Optional]: Type of collection (Index [of a single API], Collection [of multiple APIs], Blueprint [of a new API]).
    * image [Optional]: Web URL leading to an image to be used to represent the collection of
      APIs defined in this file.
    * url [Mandatory]: Web URL indicating the location of the latest version of this file
    * tags (collection) Optional]:
      this is a list of descriptive strings which identify the contents of the APIs.json file. Represented
      as an array.
    * created [Mandatory]: date of creation of the file
    * modified [Mandatory]: date of last modification of the file
    * specificationVersion [Mandatory]: version of the APIs.json specification in use.

    * apis (collection) [Optional]: list of APIs identified in the file, each containing:

        * aid [Mandatory]: A unique identifier for the api, consisting of [root domain]:[string] (ie. apis.json:spec-api)
        * name [Mandatory]: name of the API
        * description [Mandatory]: human readable text description of the API.
        * image [Optional]: URL of an image which can be used as an "icon" for the API if displayed by a
              search engine.
        * humanUrl: Web URL corresponding to human readable information about the API.
        * baseUrl: Web URL corresponding to the root URL of the API or primary endpoint.
        * version [Optional]: String representing the version number of the API this description refers to.
        * tags: (collection) [Optional]: this is a list of descriptive strings which identify the API.
      as an array.
        * properties (collection):
					- name [Optional]: The display name of the property.
					- type: please see reserved keywords below.
					- mediaType [Optional]: IANA media type representing the property.
          - url [Optional]: The URL for the property. * must be url or data
					- data [Optional]: The data for the property. * must be url or data
        * overlays (collection) [Optional]: an optional list of overlays to apply to individual APIs.
					- type [Optional]: The type of overlay being made available.
          - url [Optional]: The URL for the property. * must be url or data       
        * contact (collection)
          - [Person or Organization - see below]

    * common (collection) [Optional]: a list of common properties for use across all APIs and tools.
			- name [Optional]: The display name of the property.
			- type: please see reserved keywords below.
			- mediaType [Optional]: IANA media type representing the property.
      - url or value.

    * overlays (collection) [Optional]: an optional list of overlays to apply to primary APIs.json.
      - type [Optional]: The type of overlay being made available.
      - url [Optional]: The URL for the property. * must be url or data     

    * include (collection) [Optional]
        * name [Mandatory]: name of the APIs.json file referenced.
        * url [Mandatory]: Web URL of the file.

    * maintainers (collection)    [VCARD]
        * [Person or Organization - see below]

    The above elements determine the information to be provided (examples are provided lower down). In
    addition the format reserves keywords for types. These are listed in Section 6.

    The Person or Organization is defined as containing:

        * fn [Optional]: String Value corresponding to the Full Nname name of the individual / organization.
        * email [Optional]: String Value corresponding to the email address of the individual / organization
        * url [Optional]: String Value corresponding to a web page about the individual individual / organization
        * org [Optional]: String Value representing the name of the organization associated with the cCard.
        * adr [Optional]: String Value corresponding to the physical address of the individual / organization.
        * tel [Optional]: String Value corresponding to the phone number including country code of the individual / organization.
        * x-twitter [Optional]: String Value corresponding to the twitter username of the individual / organization (convention do
          not use the "@" symbol). Note - these are X- since this is the way they are / would be in vCard.
        * x-github [Optional]: String Value corresponding to the github username of the individual / organization. Note - these are X- since this is the way they are / would be in vCard.
        * photo [Optional]: URL corresponding to an image which could be used to represent the individual / organization.

        * vCard [Optional]: URL pointing to a vCard Objective RFC6350

    The labelled values are all taken from the vCard specification.

3.3.2.	Other Formats

   No Other Formats are currently planned

3.4.	Expiration

   Robots may cache /apis.* files, but if they do they must
   periodically verify the cached copy is fresh before using its
   contents.

   Standard HTTP cache-control mechanisms can be used by both origin
   server and robots to influence the caching of the /apis.* file.
   Specifically robots should take note of Expires header set by the
   origin server.

   If no cache-control directives are present robots should default to
   an expiry of 7 days.

3.5.  Media Type

  It is intended that if there is sufficient traction, the media type "application/apis+json" or "application/x-yaml" will be
  submitted to IANA as per RFC: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4288

3.6. JSON Schema

  A JSON schema is under development for the format.

3.7. Well Known

  It is intended that if there is sufficient traction, the "well known" location "/apis.json" or "/apis.yaml" will be
  submitted as per RFC: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5785

3.8. Link Relation

  In order for a Web site to reference its API description, it is recommended that it includes a header or
  in-line reference to the APIs.json resource using one of the api link relation, e.g.:

    * <link rel="api" type="application/apis+json" href="https://example.com/apis.json" />
		* <link rel="api" type="application/apis+yaml" href="https://example.com/apis.yaml" />

  It is intended that if there is sufficient traction, the link relation “api” will be
  submitted to IANA as per RFC: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988

3.9. Extensions

  TBD

5. 	Security Considerations

   Deploying files compliant with this recommendation on your domain may
   generate certain security risks. The recommendation is not
   intended to protect APIs, other types of resources or secure
   access in any way. The objective of the recommendation is to
   provide simple means to identify where APIs may be located on a
   given domain.

   As such external parties accessing the specification
   files will be able to determine the location of the API endpoints
   referenced within the file and hence may attempt to access them.

   All such visible endpoints should be secured in an appropriate manner.
