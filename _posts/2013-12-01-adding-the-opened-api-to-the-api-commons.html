<h2>Adding The OpenEd API To The API Commons</h2>
<p><p>
     <a href="http://www.opened.io/#/developer"><img class="c1" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/open-ed/open-ed-logo-2.png" alt="" align="right" /></a>
</p>
<p>
     We have added the <a title="OpenEd API" href="http://www.opened.io/#/developer">OpenEd API</a> to the <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>. OpenEd provides open educational resources like courses, videos and games for teachers to use in their classes.
</p>
<p>
     Using the API, developers can read and write resources to the platform, which currently houses 250K openly licensed educational resources.
</p>
<p>
     In addition to making all of the content openly licensed, the <a href="https://github.com/openedinc/opened.io">OpenEd.io site is also open sourced on Github</a>. Making the OpenEd API definition a perfect candidate for the API commons.
</p>
<p>
     The <a href="http://docs.opened.apiary.io/">OpenEd team designed their API using Apiary.io</a>, defining it using API Blueprint, a <a href="http://apiblueprint.com/">web API language that allows for the description of APIs using markdown</a>.
</p>
<p>
     OpenEd is a great open educational content API blueprint to follow, and we are honored to have it in the commons!
