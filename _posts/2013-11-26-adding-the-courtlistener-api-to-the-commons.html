<h2>Adding The CourtListener API To The Commons</h2>

<p>
     Last week the <a href="http://freelawproject.org/">Free Law Project</a> launched their <a href="http://freelawproject.org/2013/11/19/free-law-project-unveils-api-for-american-opinions/">CourtListener API</a>, which currently aggregates 2,204,339 court opinions, from 350 jurisdictions in the United States.
</p>
<p>
     This week, we are honored to have their <a title="API definition" href="https://github.com/freelawproject/court-listener-api-definition/blob/master/court-listener-api.json">API definition</a> added to the <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org/apis.html">API Commons</a>, setting a precedent for what is one possible design for a court opinion API interface, as well as a supporting data model.  
</p>
<p>
     Next up, is for the community to step up and translate this spec into other formats like <a title="RAML" href="http://raml.org/">RAML</a> or <a title="API Blueprint" href="http://apiblueprint.org/">API Blueprint</a>. With the <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/api/">CourtListener data</a> being licensed in the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/">public domain</a>, there is also great opportunity for developers to not just build client libraries and sample applications for the API, but also develop server-side tooling that will enable institutions and companies to deploy other instances of the API.
</p>
<p>
     The CourtListener API definition is the first official addition to the <a title="API Commons" href="http://apicommons.org">API Commons</a>, after <a href="http://apicommons.org/2013/10/11/after-a-very-successful-launch-of-api-commons-what-is-next/">our launch at Defrag</a>. A big thank you goes out to the <a href="http://freelawproject.org/">Free Law Project</a>, for working with with us to get the API definition added!
